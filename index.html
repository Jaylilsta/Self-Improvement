      <h2 class="card-title">The art of Evolving </h2>
      <h3>An untold story </h3>
      <p class="card-text">From the alchemy of atoms to the symphony of code,
        A metamorphosis embraced, a story to be told.
        In the crucible of chemical lore, I once danced,
        Where equations whispered, and reactions entranced.

        A canvas of compounds, a scientist's dream,
        Yet, a shift occurred, a change unforeseen.
        The allure of software, a siren's call,
        I heeded its whispers, and let my fate enthrall.

        From beakers and burners to pixels that gleam,
        A transition so seamless, like a waking dream.
        In the kingdom of algorithms, my heart found its song,
        As I painted in syntax, where passions belong.

        Circuits replaced flasks, and lines replaced bonds,
        In the binary ballet, my essence responds.
        Through the language of logic, I now communicate,
        A storyteller in code, at the digital gate.

        From distillations to debugging with grace,
        I navigate realms, a coder's embrace.
        In the language of bits, my dreams unfold,
        A chemist turned coder, in a world untold.

        So here I stand, an artist in two realms,
        In the tapestry of bytes, where the story overwhelms.
        From chemical whispers to code's sweet rendition,
        I'm a creator, a dreamer, in this digital expedition..</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Deeper Shadows</h2>
      <p>Within the shadowed square, where echoes collide,
I step through the ropes, where shadows confide.
The dance of combat, a chiaroscuro affair,
In the boxing ring, I confront my own despair.

Gloves, like weighted whispers, bind my hands,
Each punch thrown, a glimpse into life's shifting sands.
In the ring's somber ballet, a catharsis unfolds,
Where pain meets resilience, and stories are told.

Beneath the canvas canopy, a mental maze,
Where the echoes of struggles find a poetic phrase.
In the brutal embrace of combat's dark art,
I find redemption, a mending of the heart.

Yet, beyond the shadows, in the realm of grace,
I weave tales with fabrics, a stylist's embrace.
In the threads of creation, a tapestry unfolds,
Each garment a tale, as timeless as the old.

Style, not just a vesture but a soulful art,
A positive alchemy from a shadowy start.
Through garments, I whisper stories untold,
In the symphony of fashion, where dreams unfold.

Learning becomes a quest, a quest for the light,
In the realm of knowledge, where shadows take flight.
From the science of struggle to the art of attire,
I find solace and passion in wisdom's entire.

Here I stand, a pugilist of the mind,
In the ring of shadows, where truths we find.
In style's atelier, where creativity gleams,
A participant in life's intricate dreams.</p>
