      <h2 class="card-title">The art of Envolving </h2>
      <h3>An untold story </h3>
      <p class="card-text">From the alchemy of atoms to the symphony of code,
        A metamorphosis embraced, a story to be told.
        In the crucible of chemical lore, I once danced,
        Where equations whispered, and reactions entranced.

        A canvas of compounds, a scientist's dream,
        Yet, a shift occurred, a change unforeseen.
        The allure of software, a siren's call,
        I heeded its whispers, and let my fate enthrall.

        From beakers and burners to pixels that gleam,
        A transition so seamless, like a waking dream.
        In the kingdom of algorithms, my heart found its song,
        As I painted in syntax, where passions belong.

        Circuits replaced flasks, and lines replaced bonds,
        In the binary ballet, my essence responds.
        Through the language of logic, I now communicate,
        A storyteller in code, at the digital gate.

        From distillations to debugging with grace,
        I navigate realms, a coder's embrace.
        In the language of bits, my dreams unfold,
        A chemist turned coder, in a world untold.

        So here I stand, an artist in two realms,
        In the tapestry of bytes, where the story overwhelms.
        From chemical whispers to code's sweet rendition,
        I'm a creator, a dreamer, in this digital expedition..</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Deeper Shadows</h2>
      <p>In the tapestry of dreams, where hues entwine,
        I, a weaver of threads, in a realm so divine.
        Fashion's whisper, a palette of expression,
        Each stitch, a note in the symphony of confession.

        Silhouettes waltz in the atelier of my mind,
        Creativity's dance, a designer's bind.
        From imagination's runway to streets of flair,
        Textures sculpted, a couturier's affair.

        Bibliophile of whispers, I court the word,
        In literature's garden, where stories are stirred.
        Pages turn like petals, tales unfold,
        In the prose-filled haven, where dreams are bold.

        Conversations, canvases, words my brush,
        Painting connections, in a palette so lush.
        From the art of dialogue to discourse's dance,
        Crafting my voice, each syllable's trance.

        New faces, stories waiting to be read,
        In the book of encounters, where no chapter is dead.
        Communing with strangers, language unspoken,
        Building bridges of words, the silence broken.

        Here I stand, a kaleidoscope of expression,
        Fashioned from passion, words in succession.
        In life's gallery, where creativity gleams,
        Threads and poems, artist of dreams.</p>
